  - The number of API server workers, i.e., the number of gevent workers. Formula: `number of cpu cores x 2 + 1`

## How to configure environment variables not found in `values.yaml`?
If you want to configure the environment variables not found in `values.yaml`, you can use the `extraEnv` field in the `values.yaml` file. 

```yaml
api:
  extraEnv:
    - name: "DEMO_ENV_VAR"
      value: "demo"
```

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

## How to configure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`?
Sometimes, for security reasons, you may need to configure the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables for the Dify `API` service.
You can use the `extraEnv` field in the `values.yaml` file. 

```yaml
api:
  extraEnv:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    - name: "HTTPS_PROXY"
