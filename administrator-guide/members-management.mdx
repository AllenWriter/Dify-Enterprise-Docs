# Member Management

Administrators can view and manage all members within the enterprise in the **Members** page, including members' permission roles in various Workspaces, member status, and view members' creation date and last active date.

## Member Permission Management

Each member has permissions at both the team level and Workspace level. System administrators can add team members and invite new system administrators, as well as assign a member's permissions to a Workspace.

### Team-level Permissions

1. **Regular User**
   - Users added on the Members page have regular user permissions by default.
   - Members in this user group can perform the following operations:
     * Log in and use the Dify enterprise

2. **System Administrator**
   - Users added on the Settings page have system administrator permissions by default.
   - Members in this user group can perform the following operations:
     * Log in to the enterprise dashboard
     * Add / delete / disable team members
     * Add members to Workspaces and assign permissions

   For more operations guides for system administrators, please refer to System Settings Docs.

### Workspace-level Permissions

Workspaces include three permission groups: Owner, Admin, and Normal.

1. **Owner**
   - The creator of the Workspace. 
   - Each workspace has only one Owner.
   - Has the permission to create and edit all applications within the workspace.
   - Can enter the settings page to add model providers, create API extensions, and other operations.

2. **Admin**
   - Workspace administrators. 
   - Each workspace can have multiple administrators.
   - Has the permission to create and edit all applications within the workspace.
   - Can enter the settings page to add model providers, create API extensions, and other operations.

3. **Normal**
   - Normal members of the Workspace. 
   - Each workspace can have multiple regular members.
   - Can only use applications within the workspace but cannot edit or modify them.
   - Cannot access the settings page to add model providers, create API extensions, or perform similar operations.

## Adding New Members to the Team

If your team hasn't enabled SSO authentication, you can log in using a username and password.

1. Click the blue Add button in the upper right corner
2. Fill in the username and email
3. When adding a member for the first time, the default login password will be displayed only once

To add an administrator to the team, please refer to System Administrator Settings Docs.

## Adding New Members to a Workspace

If you want to add new members to a specific workspace, please refer to Workspace Management Docs.

## Disabling Members

Compared to directly deleting members, disabling members allows you to deny user access requests while retaining their data. 

To disable a member:
1. Click the menu button on the right side of the member's entry
2. Switch their Status to "banned"

## Resetting Member Passwords

If a member has lost their password, the system administrator needs to manually send a password reset email. 

1. Click the menu button on the right side of the member's entry
2. Tap "Reset Password"

## Deleting Members

⚠️ **All applications and usage data under the member's name will be deleted. Please handle with caution.**

To delete a member:
1. Click the menu button on the right side of a member
2. Tap the "Delete" option

**Note**: Once members are added to a workspace, they cannot be removed. Clicking Delete on the Members page will be considered as removing the member from the team.

## Searching for Members

Administrators can query users in the search box using workspace ID and user email, and you can also switch user status for queries.
