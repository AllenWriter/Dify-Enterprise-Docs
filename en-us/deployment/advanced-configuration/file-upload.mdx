## Find the File Upload configuration in the Helm Chart Values
### Display Helm Chart Values
```bash
helm show values dify/dify
```

This is an example of the file upload configuration in the Helm chart values.
```yaml
api:
  limits:
    # upload file size limit in MB
    uploadFileSize: 15
    # upload file batch count limit
    uploadFileBatchCount: 5
    # upload image file size limit in MB
    uploadImageFileSize: 5
  ... ...
```

## Nginx Ingress Controller Configuration
If you are using the Nginx Ingress Controller, you should set the file upload size limit in the `annotations` field, too.

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  annotations: {
    # set file upload size limit
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "15m"
  }
  ... ...
```
