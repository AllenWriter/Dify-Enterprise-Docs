Admin APIs adhere to REST API standards, enabling efficient automation and management within the Dify Enterprise platform. These APIs support querying and modifying information for the following resources:

- **Workspaces**: Global workspace management, including retrieving workspace information, creating workspaces, and performing management operations.
- **Members**: Global team member management, including fetching team member details, adding members, and managing member accounts.
- **Workspace Member**: Member management within a specific workspace, including retrieving member information and managing member.

> More features will be supported with future version updates.

<Note>
To avoid confusion, Dify distinguishes between different levels of API services:

- APIs provided by applications (accessed via interface calls) are referred to as **Workspace APIs**.
- APIs for managing platform-level operations are collectively called **Admin APIs**.
</Note>

## Endpoint URL

Admin APIs use the following endpoint address. When making API calls, replace `your-domain` with your Dify Enterprise platform domain name and append the specific request path to form the complete API endpoint.

```bash
https://your-domain/admin-api/v1
```

---

## Authentication

API requests require a Secret Key for authentication. To obtain one, navigate to the **Admin APIs** page in the Dify Enterprise admin dashboard and create a key.

<Warning>
Modifying data via Admin APIs may impact production data within your organization. Exercise caution when performing such operations.
</Warning>
