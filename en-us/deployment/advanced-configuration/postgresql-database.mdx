## `max_connections` configuration

- If you encounter the error message `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections`, you need to increase the `max_connections` configuration for the Postgresql database.
- Suggestions:
  - The default value is 100.
  - Suggest setting the `max_connections` value to `2000`.
