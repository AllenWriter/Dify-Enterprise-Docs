## Model Provider Configuration
Model provider supports the following configuration options, the model provider name is the folder name in the `api/core/model_runtime/model_providers` directory.
- `pins`
  - If is not empty, it will pin the given model providers to the top of the list.
- `includes`
  - If is empty, it will display all the model providers.
  - If is not empty, it will only display the given model providers.
- `excludes`
  - If is not empty, it will exclude the given model providers.

The following example will display the `ollama` model provider at the top of the list, and only display the `sagemaker` and `ollama`.
```yaml

  positionProvider:
    pins: "ollama"
    includes: "openai,sagemaker,ollama"
    excludes: "openai"
```
