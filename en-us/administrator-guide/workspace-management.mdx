title: Workspace Management

Workspace is where team members create and manage their various AI applications. Administrators can view and manage all workspaces on the Workspaces page of the Enterprise dashboard.

## Creating a New Workspace

Click the blue "Add" button in the upper right corner of the Workspace page, enter a name and specify a team member's email to create a new workspace within the team. Each Workspace must be assigned an Owner. For details on member permissions within a workspace, please refer to [Member Management](/en-us/administrator-guide/members-management).

## Managing Workspaces

Workspaces support modifying names and status; you can also reassign the Owner. Click the menu button on the right side of the Workspace, tap the "Edit" option, and make changes on the newly opened editing page.

## Adding Members to a Workspace

Administrators can add members to a workspace on the backend. Click the menu button on the right side of the Workspace, tap "Join member", assign the Role for the new member and add the member's email.
- Admin: Has management permissions for the Workspace, can create and edit applications
- Normal: Regular member, only has viewing permissions for applications within the Workspace, cannot create or edit applications

After adding a member to a workspace, the member cannot be removed from the workspace.

## Adjusting Workspace Status

Workspaces include the following two statuses:
- Normal
  The current workspace is operating normally, members can normally use or create applications in the workspace.
- Archive
  The current workspace has been archived, members cannot continue to use or create applications in the workspace.

## Deleting a Workspace

⚠️ This operation is dangerous, and all data within the workspace will be lost after deletion.
Click the menu button on the right side of the Workspace, tap "Delete" to complete the deletion.

## Searching for Workspaces

Administrators can query all workspaces in the enterprise version through the workspace ID and name in the search box. Click "Reset" to reset all search conditions.
