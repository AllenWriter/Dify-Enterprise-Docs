## Members Management

### Adding New Members to the Team

If your team hasn't enabled SSO authentication, you can log in using a username and password.

1. Click the blue Add button in the upper right corner
2. Fill in the username and email
3. When adding a member for the first time, the default login password will be displayed only once

To add an administrator to the team, please refer to [System Settings](/en-us/administrator-guide/system-settings).

### Adding New Members to a Workspace

If you want to add new members to a specific workspace, please refer to Workspace Management Docs.

### Disabling Members

Compared to directly deleting members, disabling members allows you to deny user access requests while retaining their data. 

To disable a member:
1. Click the menu button on the right side of the member's entry
2. Switch their Status to "banned"

**Note**: Once members are added to a workspace, they cannot be removed. Clicking Delete on the Members page will be considered as removing the member from the team.

### Searching for Members

Administrators can query users in the search box using workspace ID and user email, and you can also switch user status for queries.

## Member Permission Management

Each member has permissions at both the team level and Workspace level. System administrators can add team members and invite new system administrators, as well as assign a member's permissions to a Workspace.

## Member Group Management

<Info>
  Requires Dify Enterprise Edition version ≥v2.6.0.
</Info>

In Dify Enterprise Edition, **Group Management** is a mechanism for controlling member access to different resources within the enterprise. By assigning members to different groups, you can effectively control which users can access which Web Apps, preventing resource misuse or potential data leakage risks, and ensuring enterprise information security.

### Creating Groups

Click **Group Management** in the upper right corner of the **Members** page, enter the group name to complete creation; group names must be unique and cannot be duplicated.

### Editing Groups

Groups support renaming and drag-and-drop reordering. Click the **Edit** button to the right of the group name to rename it; the new name must not duplicate any existing group.

### Assigning Users

Click the **Menu** button to the right of a member → **Edit Groups**, and select the groups to add the user to. Each user can be added to multiple different groups simultaneously.

After adding users to groups, please refer to [Application Publishing: Application Access Permission Management](en-us/user-guide/application-publishing/permission-management) to learn how to control Web App access permissions.
