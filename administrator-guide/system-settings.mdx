# System Administrator Management

System administrators can manage the team users on the **Settings** page. They have the following permissions:

* Log in to the enterprise dashboard
* Add / delete / disable team members
* Add Owners to Workspace
* Add new members to Workspace and assign permissions

## Adding System Administrators

The creator of the enterprise dashboard is the default first system administrator. Any system administrator can invite others to become system administrators.

1. Click the blue Add button in the upper right corner of the Settings page
2. Enter the user's name and email to complete the addition

**Note**: If a system administrator's email is not added to the **"Members"** list, they do not have permission to create and use workspaces. If you want the system administrator to be able to create or join a Workspace, please refer to "Adding Members to a Workspace" Docs.
