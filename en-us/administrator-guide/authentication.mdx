## Workspace Configuration

### 1. Managing Authentication Methods

Dify Enterprise provides three authentication methods for workspaces: Email + Password, Email + Verification Code, and Single Sign-On (SSO). System administrators can flexibly set up platform authentication methods based on business requirements, achieving unified management of organization members' authentication methods in the Dify workspace.

## Managing Account Creation Methods

Dify Enterprise allows administrators to flexibly configure account creation methods: "Allow users to create accounts" and "Allow system to automatically create personal spaces". This reduces management burden, improves organization members' account access efficiency, and ensures smooth collaboration and platform usage.

### 2.1 Allow Users to Create Accounts

Click the toggle button on the right side of "Allow users to create accounts" in the "Authentication Methods -> Workspace Settings" area to allow users to create accounts independently.
Once enabled, users can register accounts independently but cannot immediately access the Dify Enterprise platform until invited to join a space by a system administrator.

### 2.2 Allow System to Automatically Create Personal Spaces

Click the toggle button on the right side of "Allow system to automatically create personal spaces" in the "Authentication Methods -> Workspace Settings" area to allow the system to automatically create personal spaces for users after account creation.
Once enabled, users need to be invited to join the enterprise by a system administrator to use the Dify Enterprise platform, and the system will automatically create a personal space for that user.

### 2.3 Flexible Configuration Combinations

- **Both Enabled**: Organization members are allowed to register accounts independently. After registration, the system automatically creates a personal space for them, and members can immediately start using the Dify Enterprise platform without waiting for administrator invitation.

- **Only "System Automatically Create Personal Spaces" Enabled**: Even with "System Automatically Create Personal Spaces" enabled, organization members still need a system administrator invitation to register and activate their account; self-registration will not be available.
