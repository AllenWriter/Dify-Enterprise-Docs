## Find the Tools configuration in the Helm Chart Values
### Display Helm Chart Values
```bash
helm show values dify/dify
```

This is an example of the tools configuration in the Helm chart values.
```yaml
api:
  positionTool:
    pins: ""
    includes: ""
    excludes: ""
  ... ...
```

## Tools Configuration
Tools supports the following configuration options. The tool name is the folder name in the `api/core/tools/provider/builtin` directory.
- `pins`
  - If is not empty, it will pin the given tools to the top of the list.
- `includes`
    - If is empty, it will display all the tools.
    - If is not empty, it will only display the given tools.
- `excludes`
    - If is not empty, it will exclude the given tools.

The following example will display the `dalle` tool at the top of the list, and only display the `bing` and `dalle`.
```yaml
api:
  positionTool:
    pins: "dalle"
    includes: "google,bing,dalle"
    excludes: "google"
```
