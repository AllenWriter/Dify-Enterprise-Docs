## 2. How to Adjust Member Permissions in a Workspace?

Scenario: Member A is added to a workspace with Normal permission role. How can you change Member A's permission to Admin?

Currently, it's not possible to switch member permissions within [System Settings](/en-us/administrator-guide/system-settings). To adjust permissions, you need to remove Member A and then re-add them with the Admin role.

If you need to continue adding members to the workspace, it's recommended to have the workspace administrator directly invite members to join the space. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Team Member Management](/en-us/user-guide/management/team-members-management).
